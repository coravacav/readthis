## It depends is both the most frustrating yet most accurate answer to most any question

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I think it's a good thing to keep in mind.

ye, also one last thing
it's really hard to do things wrong if you're
looking for how to do things better
actively thinking about what you're doing and not being passive ok with the status quo

that's it
there's like nothing else really to it, everything including studying boils down to that

design and architecture of software is an art and there's no way to learn art but practice
you can't tell a painter to study paintings and expect them to be able to paint
you stumbling over yourself and making bad decisions is a good sign you're doing things right
literally nobody gets it right the first time unless they're lucky
there's no consistent way to learn the right way from the get go

my perfect engineer i'd like to hire has three things
knowledge of the basics (this is some studying / practice)
knowledge of what to search when the basics don't cut it (this is a skill you practice)
a good attitude (but this goes for anyone i'd like to hire)

side note: the "basics" change per problem domain

i mean you don't need to learn those problems in advance
why are you expecting yourself to know the solution to a problem you don't have?
that sounds pointless
you have the internet and a plethora of other resources at your fingertips
prelearning basically anything other than the basics is pointless

i think the important part is that you can learn algorithms ad-hoc, you don't need to learn them before you do anything
it sounds stupid and philosophical but if you question everything and google every step of the way, you'll learn way more practical things way more effectively than any leetcode prep (or similar "prereading")

a great engineer comes from thinking about what you're doing mostly
