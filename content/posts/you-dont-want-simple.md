## Simplicity seems to be what many want.

The push for simplicity is why we've seen a spike in popularity of [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for the web, the [continued push against microservices](https://dev.to/anthony_hagi/you-dont-need-microservices-a-real-world-perspective-1kck), or the [continued recommendations to use C]().

I'm not here to defend or advocate for any of these technologies or practices, but I do want to point out that simplicity is not the end goal.

## What is simplicity anyway?

## An aside on DRY

## What technologies do people like?
